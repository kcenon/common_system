/**
@mainpage Common System

@section overview Overview
Common System provides foundational C++ interfaces and patterns that promote
loose coupling and consistent error handling across the project. It is
primarily a header-only library designed to be easy to integrate in other
system modules (thread, logger, monitoring, container, database, network).

@section features Key Features
- Result<T> type for exception-free error handling
- Event bus abstraction with optional monitoring-system integration
- Executor interfaces for pluggable threading backends

@section usage Usage
The library is installed as a set of headers. After installation or adding the
repository as a submodule, include the headers from `kcenon/common` and link
the CMake interface target `kcenon::common` when needed.

@section build Build
The project uses CMake. It can be consumed as a header-only target by default,
and optionally built as a static library by turning off `COMMON_HEADER_ONLY`.
